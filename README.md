## 🚀 About Me

I’m an MSc Computer Science & Business Technology graduate with a hybrid profile spanning **AI engineering**, **ML systems**, **data science**, and **software engineering**. I build practical solutions that blend cutting-edge generative AI with robust software architecture, ranging from multi-agent orchestration platforms to scalable ML pipelines.

I’ve contributed to systems, such as a **multi-agent risk classifier at BHSI** that cut underwriting reviews from hours to minutes, and prototyped autonomous research and trading systems across diverse LLMs and cloud platforms.

I’m currently focused on full-stack AI systems, async orchestration, observability, and scalable MLOps pipelines that bridge data science and production software.
